Insights

BokoHaram is linked to 45.5% of all attacks in West Africa.
Nigeria alone accounts for the highest number of incidents, especially in Maiduguri.

Observations

1. Most Affected City: Maiduguri stands out as the most affected city, with over 450 recorded crime incidents. Other cities like Kano, Bamenda, and Port Harcourt are also significantly impacted. Some incidents also happen in an unknown location.
2. Top Perpetrator Group: Boko Haram is responsible for 45.53% of the recorded incident which is the largest by any group in West Africa.
3. Target Types: Private citizens and property are the most frequent targets, with nearly 4,000 incidents.
4. Nigeria is the most affected country with 5550 incidents followed by Cameroun, Niger, Chad, Ghana.
5. A steady increase is observed in 2009, peak occur in 2018 with 919 incidents

Recommendations

1. Since Nigeria has the highest incidents rate, Nigeria should be prioritized for counter insurgency operations like the operations Lafya Dole lunched in Maiduguri in 2015.
2. Enhance surveillance and protection for affected areas by employing the services of local vigilante, hunter groups.
3. Strengthen efforts to track and dismantle BokoHaram and Fulani extremist networks.
4. Deploy community-based programs in cities like Maiduguri, Kano, and Port Harcourt to engage local populations.
5. I do recommend an analysis be conducted into why 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 saw a peak and what interventions was introduced to reduce it.

Conclusion

The findings reveal that Nigeria is the most affected country in West Africa, with Maiduguri identified as the most targeted city, by the terrorist group called Boko Haram. Private citizens and property were the most frequent targets. A sharp rise in attacks occurred after 2009, peaking around 2014–2015, reflecting the escalation of extremist activities. The data also indicates that while Boko Haram is the most dominant perpetrator group, a significant portion of incidents remain unattributed or unknown.
